The Miller Lab\u0026rsquo;s long-term goal is to identify and develop novel therapeutics for advanced skin cancer and to understand the mechanism of response and resistance to those therapies.\nDr. Miller graduated with Honors from Boston College where he earned a BA in Political Science. He received his medical (MD) and PhD degree in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Massachusetts. While at UMass, Dr. Miller received the American Diabetes Association Physician-Scientist Training Award, a Fuller Foundation grant, and he was inducted into the Alpha Omega Honor Society.\nHe then completed a Dermatology residency at Columbia University Medical Center, followed by a residency in Internal Medicine at Brigham and Women\u0026rsquo;s Hospital. Following both residencies, Dr. Miller completed fellowship training in Hematology/Oncology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and in the Oncology Center of Excellence at the Food and Drug Administration.\nDr. Miller is one of the very few clinicians in the country who is board certified in Internal Medicine, Dermatology and Medical Oncology. He currently practices both Dermatology and Medical Oncology in the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, where he co-directs multidiscliplinary clinics in advanced skin cancer, including the Merkel Cell Carcinoma Treatment Program.\nDr. Miller belongs to several professional organizations, including the American Academy of Dermatology, Medical Dermatology Society, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology. He has numerous peer-reviewed publications and he has presented his work at the Society for Investigative Dermatology, New York Academy of Medicine, the American Academy of Dermatology, and the U.S. FDA. He is also a reviewer for the British Journal of Dermatology, Journal of Investigative Dermatology, JAEDV, and Clinical Cancer Research.\nDue to his expertise in Merkel Cell Carcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Dr. Miller has also served on advisory boards to several pharmaceutical companies, inlcuding Pfizer, Merck, Regeneron and Sanofi Genzyme.\nThe Miller Lab\u0026rsquo;s research portfolio consists of clinical and translational projects in Merkel Cell carcinoma, cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Melanoma. Dr. Miller has received support for his research from the NIH in the form of a loan repayment award, a Research Grant from the American Skin Association, the Paul Carbone, MD fellowship award from ECOG-ACRIN, and the Mentoring Award in Oncology, Advanced Analytics and Regulatory Science from Project Data Sphere.\nBoard Certifications\nDermatology, American Board of Dermatology\nInternal Medicine, American Board of Internal Medicine\nMedical Oncology, American Board of Internal Medicine\nDr. Miller\u0026rsquo;s Link to the MGH Cancer Center\n","date":1576242000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1576242000,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"David Michael Miller, MD, PhD, FAAD is a Board-Certified Dermatologist and Medical Oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and investigator in the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center.

Output from RAS promotes cell proliferation and survival by activating the MAPK kinase pathway (BRAF-MEK-ERK) and the PI3K-PIP3-AKT pathway.  Legend for Melanoma Pathways Figure (cont.)  Cell proliferation is triggered by increased transcription of cyclin D family members via output from both MAPK and PI3K signaling. MAPK signaling induces expression of cyclin D1, via JNK, ERK and AP-1 (Jun and c-fos), which leads to the liberation of E2F.\n  Legend for Melanoma Pathways Figure (cont.)  Transcription of cyclin D is also promoted when AKT activation stimulates mTOR to inhibit 4E-BP1, a suppressor of eIF4E.\n  Legend for Melanoma Pathways Figure (cont.)  In addition, cyclin D–CDK4/6 complexes promote cell growth by stabilizing FOXM1 through multisite phosphorylation, leading to the expression of mitogenic genes, such as CDK1 and members of the cyclin A, B, D and E families. The RAS-PI3K pathway also antagonizes the GSK3b phosphorylation of cyclin D–CDK4/6 complexes, which results in ubiquitination and proteasome degradation.\n  Legend for Melanoma Pathways Figure (cont.)  Several antiapoptotic pathways are induced downstream of RAS. RSK activation of CREB upregulates BCL2 and antagonizes apoptosis at the level of the mitochondria. BCL2 activity is further promoted by the AKT-mediated phosphorylation, and subsequent inhibition, of the pro-apoptotic BAD.\n  Legend for Melanoma Pathways Figure (cont.)  RAS is downregulated by GTPase-activating proteins such as NF1, which facilitates the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Conversely, GEFs stimulate the release of GDP to allow for binding of GTP by RAS and subsequent activation. Legend for Cycle-Cycle Figure is from: Miller DM, Flaherty KT. Pigment Cell Melanoma Research. 2014 May;27(3):351-65  Legend for Cycle Cycle Figure  The cell cycle is regulated by the dynamic interactions of highly coordinated enzymatic proteins to ensure genomic fidelity.  Legend for Cycle Cycle Figure (cont.)  Cells first enter the cell cycle after receiving mitogenic signals, from stimuli such as RAS, which activate the cyclin D-dependent kinases, CDK4 and CDK6, via increased expression of cyclin D and by triggering release from inhibitory INK4 (p15 and p16) and CIP/KIP (p21CIP1 and p27KIP1) proteins.   Legend for Cycle Cycle Figure (cont.)  Early in G1, RB is initially phosphorylated by cyclin D–CDK4/6 complexes, which abrogates the RB-dependent inhibition of the transcription factor E2F. E2F transcription factors are then released from the partially phosphorylated RB and promote transcription of genes (e.g. CCNE1) necessary to progress through the G1/S checkpoint.\n  Legend for Cycle Cycle Figure (cont.)  RB is further phosphorylated in late G1 by cyclin E–CDK2 complexes, enabling E2F transcription factors to express genes required for DNA synthesis. After entry into the S phase, a hyperphosphorylated state of RB is maintained by the activities of cyclin A–CDK2, cyclin A–CDK1 and cyclin B–CDK1 complexes.  Legend for Cycle Cycle Figure (cont.)  At the end of mitosis RB proteins are dephosphorylated by phosphatases allowing recombination with E2F and DP to prevent unregulated cell proliferation. The cell cycle is negatively regulated by members of the INK4 (p15, p16) and CIP/KIP families (p21CIP1 and p27KIP1) Legend for Cycle-Cycle Figure is from: Miller DM, Flaherty KT.
