title: Melanoma - Pathogenesis, Diagnosis and Work Up
---

# Melanoma
## Pathogenesis, Diagnosis and Work Up


---

## Learning Objective

- Review basic epidemiology of melanoma
- Review molecular mechanisms of melanoma
- Discuss risk factors for melanoma
- Review how to evaluate and stage patients
- Overview of management of melanoma


---

## Epidemiology

- 1:25 Americans will get some kind of melanoma in their lifetime
- 1:52 Americans will get an invasive melanoma in their lifetime
- Estimated to be 96,480 newly diagnosed cases of invasive melanoma in the U.S. in 2019
  - 95,830 cases of melanoma in situ 
- Between 9,000-10,000 deaths annually

## Pathogenesis

## Legend for Melanoma Pathways Figure  

- Mitogenic stimuli from growth factor receptors such as c-KIT result in activation of RAS. 
- Output from RAS promotes cell proliferation and survival by activating the MAPK kinase pathway (BRAF-MEK-ERK) and the PI3K-PIP3-AKT pathway. 

---

## Legend for Melanoma Pathways Figure (cont.)  

- Cell proliferation is triggered by increased transcription of cyclin D family members via output from both MAPK and PI3K signaling. MAPK signaling induces expression of cyclin D1, via JNK, ERK and AP-1 (Jun and c-fos), which leads to the liberation of E2F.  

---

## Legend for Melanoma Pathways Figure (cont.)  

- Transcription of cyclin D is also promoted when AKT activation stimulates mTOR to inhibit 4E-BP1, a suppressor of eIF4E.  

---

## Legend for Melanoma Pathways Figure (cont.)  

- In addition, cyclin D–CDK4/6 complexes promote cell growth by stabilizing FOXM1 through multisite phosphorylation, leading to the expression of mitogenic genes, such as CDK1 and members of the cyclin A, B, D and E families. The RAS-PI3K pathway also antagonizes the GSK3b phosphorylation of cyclin D–CDK4/6 complexes, which results in ubiquitination and proteasome degradation.

## Legend for Melanoma Pathways Figure (cont.)  

- Several antiapoptotic pathways are induced downstream of RAS. 
- RSK activation of CREB upregulates BCL2 and antagonizes apoptosis at the level of the mitochondria. 
- BCL2 activity is further promoted by the AKT-mediated phosphorylation, and subsequent inhibition, of the pro-apoptotic BAD.

## Legend for Melanoma Pathways Figure (cont.)  

- RAS is downregulated by GTPase-activating proteins such as NF1, which facilitates the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Conversely, GEFs stimulate the release of GDP to allow for binding of GTP by RAS and subsequent activation.

## Legend for Cycle Cycle Figure

- The cell cycle is regulated by the dynamic interactions of highly coordinated enzymatic proteins to ensure genomic fidelity. 

---

## Legend for Cycle Cycle Figure (cont.)  

- Cells first enter the cell cycle after receiving mitogenic signals, from stimuli such as RAS, which activate the cyclin D-dependent kinases, CDK4 and CDK6, via increased expression of cyclin D and by triggering release from inhibitory INK4 (p15 and p16) and CIP/KIP (p21CIP1 and p27KIP1) proteins.

## Legend for Cycle Cycle Figure (cont.)  

- Early in G1, RB is initially phosphorylated by cyclin D–CDK4/6 complexes, which abrogates the RB-dependent inhibition of the transcription factor E2F. 
- E2F transcription factors are then released from the partially phosphorylated RB and promote transcription of genes (e.g. CCNE1) necessary to progress through the G1/S checkpoint.   

---
## Legend for Cycle Cycle Figure (cont.)  

- RB is further phosphorylated in late G1 by cyclin E–CDK2 complexes, enabling E2F transcription factors to express genes required for DNA synthesis. After entry into the S phase, a hyperphosphorylated state of RB is maintained by the activities of cyclin A–CDK2, cyclin A–CDK1 and cyclin B–CDK1 complexes. 

---
## Legend for Cycle Cycle Figure (cont.)  

- At the end of mitosis RB proteins are dephosphorylated by phosphatases allowing recombination with E2F and DP to prevent unregulated cell proliferation. The cell cycle is negatively regulated by members of the INK4 (p15, p16) and CIP/KIP families (p21CIP1 and p27KIP1)
