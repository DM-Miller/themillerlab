# Overview
The Merkel Cell Carcinoma Patient Registry is a multi-institutional collaborative effort that is collecting data on outcomes and events in MCC patients. MCC is the prototypical rare tumor, and this Registry aims to develop new methodologies that will enable investigators to examine real world data in real time. Deliverables from the Registry include: (i) precise patient risk stratification, (ii) real-world data for drug development programs, (iii) identification of optimal sequence and combinations therapies, (iv) uncovering low-incidence toxicities and (v) revelations about best practices, (vi) and the generation of novel testable hypotheses.
