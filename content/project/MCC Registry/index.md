# Overview
Dr. Miller is a co-chair, along with [Dr. Michael K. Wong](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/michael_wong.html), of a [Project Data Sphere (PDS)](https://www.projectdatasphere.org/projectdatasphere/html/home)-led Task Force of key opinion leaders who are working together to develop a multi-institutional registry for patients with [Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC)](https://www.merkelcellcarcinoma.io).

The Merkel Cell Carcinoma Patient Registry is a multi-institutional collaborative effort that is collecting data on outcomes and events in MCC patients. MCC is the prototypical rare tumor, and this Registry aims to develop new methodologies that will enable investigators to examine real world data in real time. Deliverables from the Registry include: (i) precise patient risk stratification, (ii)  real-world data for drug development programs, (iii) identification of optimal sequence and combinations therapies, (iv) uncovering low-incidence toxicities and (v) revelations about best practices, (vi) and the generation of novel testable hypotheses. 
 
The MCC Task Force comprises members from academic medical centers, the drug industry, the NIH and the FDA.  Project Data Sphere, LLC provides a secure, open-access data sharing platform and comprehensive support to optimize research performance and ensure rigorous and timely results. The Registry is currently in Part 1 of a two-stage Pilot project, in which we are collecting MCC outcomes at the MGH and the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center to clarify what data elements to collect, how to code the data and how to standardize the information collection in a way to facilitate analysis.
