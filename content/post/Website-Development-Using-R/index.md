title: Website Development With R
---

## Overview
* This working document is a rough user guide on how to create a website using R via a package called `blogdown`. It will also walk you through opening in account on Netlify, which will host your website.
* There are numerous resources for webpage development, including an amazing bookdown called "blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown" (https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). We've created this resource as we have tried to provide details and pearls that we struggled with and we belive these may be helpful to others.
* This is a ongoing, 'living' document that is constantly being edited and expanded. Please provide comments to allow us to optimize this document for all R users.
